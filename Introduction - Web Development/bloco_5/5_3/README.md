Exercises: Events
Mad Libs
Start with this webpage (ex1_1.html), which has several input elements and a button:

Add a script tag to the bottom of the page for your code.
Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")

Calculator
Start with this webpage(ex1_2.html), which has inputs and buttons for things to calculate:

Add a script tag, and add the functions from the calculator exercise (view the solution if you haven't done it yet).
For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result of the calculation in the solution div.
Bonus: respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button.

Who needs Milan when you have JavaScript?

Start with this webpage (ex3.html), which has a single img tag of an animated GIF of a cat walking.
Add a script tag at the bottom of the page, where you'll put all your code.
Create a variable to store a reference to the img.
Change the style of the img to have a "left" of "0px", so that it starts at the left hand of the screens.
Create a function called catWalk() that moves the cat 10 pixels to the right of where it started, by changing the "left" style property.
Call that function every 50 milliseconds. Your cat should now be moving across the screen from left to right. Hurrah!

Bonus #1: When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, restart them at the left hand side ("0px"). So they should keep walking from left to right across the screen, forever and ever.

Bonus #2: When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, make them move backwards instead. They should keep walking back and forth forever and ever.
